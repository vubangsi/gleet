- [x] Existing code continues to work
- [x] New features are additive only
- [x] No database schema changes required

## Documentation

- [x] Setup guide created
- [x] Troubleshooting guide created
- [x] Quick reference created
- [x] Technical summary created
- [x] This verification checklist created

## Ready for Production

✅ **Email service is fully functional and ready for use**

### Next Steps
1. Deploy code changes
2. Ensure `.env` has correct Gmail credentials
3. Run `npm run db:seed` on production
4. Monitor email logs for any issues
5. Test email sending in production environment

### Monitoring
