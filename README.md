## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key
- Gmail app password for email service

### Quick Start

**üöÄ One-Command Startup (Recommended)**

```bash
# For macOS/Linux
./start.sh

# For Windows
start.bat

# Or using npm
npm run start:full
```

The startup script will automatically:
- Kill any existing process on port 3000
- Install dependencies if needed
- **Generate Prisma client** and set up database
- **Auto-switch authentication mode** based on database availability
- Seed the database with initial data
- Start the development server

**üéØ Smart Mode Switching:**
- If database setup succeeds ‚Üí **Full Mode** (real authentication with Prisma)
- If database setup fails ‚Üí **Simplified Mode** (mock authentication for testing)

### Manual Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd gleet
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   Update the `.env` file with your credentials:
   ```env
   # Database
   DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"

   # NextAuth
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-replace-with-random-string"

   # GitHub OAuth (optional)
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="your-github-client-id"
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="your-github-client-secret"

   # OpenAI
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

   # Email - Gmail SMTP
   EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=465
   EMAIL_SERVER_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-app-password
   EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   npm run db:generate
   npm run db:push
   npm run db:seed
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Authentication Mode Management

You can manually switch between authentication modes:

```bash
# Switch to full database-integrated authentication
npm run auth:full

# Switch to simplified mock authentication  
npm run auth:simple

# Check current application status
./check-status.sh
```

**Full Mode Features:**
- Real user registration with database storage
- Email verification with tokens
- Session management with Prisma
- GitHub OAuth integration

**Simplified Mode Features:**
- Mock user registration (no database required)
- Simulated email verification
- Console logging for debugging
- Works without any external dependencies

## üìä Database Schema

The application uses a comprehensive database schema with the following key entities:

- **Users**: User accounts with GitHub integration

- **Monitoring**: Real-time status tracking and error handling
- **Notifications**: Email notifications for completed tasks

### Agent Development
Each agent extends the `BaseAgent` class and implements:

```typescript
abstract class BaseAgent {
  abstract execute(task: AgentTask): Promise<AgentResult>
}
```
