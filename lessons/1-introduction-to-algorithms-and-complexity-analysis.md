# Introduction to Algorithms and Complexity Analysis

## Overview
In this lesson, we will explore the fundamental concepts of algorithms and complexity analysis. Understanding algorithms is crucial for solving computational problems efficiently, while complexity analysis helps us evaluate the performance of these algorithms. By the end of this lesson, you will have a solid foundation in algorithm design and the tools to analyze their efficiency.

## Key Concepts

### 1. What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. It consists of a finite sequence of well-defined instructions that can be executed to achieve a specific goal.

### 2. Characteristics of Algorithms
- **Finiteness**: An algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
- **Definiteness**: Each step of the algorithm must be precisely defined.
- **Input**: An algorithm can have zero or more inputs.
- **Output**: An algorithm produces one or more outputs.
- **Effectiveness**: The operations to be performed must be sufficiently basic that they can be done exactly and in a finite amount of time.

### 3. Types of Algorithms
- **Brute Force**: Tries all possible solutions to find the best one.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Breaks the problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and combines their solutions.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solves complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Makes the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.

### 4. Complexity Analysis
Complexity analysis is the study of the resources required by an algorithm to solve a problem. The two main types of complexity are:

- **Time Complexity**: Measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input.
- **Space Complexity**: Measures the amount of memory space an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input.

### 5. Big O Notation
Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity. It provides a high-level understanding of the algorithm's efficiency. Common complexities include:
- O(1): Constant time
- O(log n): Logarithmic time
- O(n): Linear time
- O(n log n): Linearithmic time
- O(n^2): Quadratic time
- O(2^n): Exponential time

## Code Walkthrough
Letâ€™s implement a simple algorithm to find the maximum number in a list and analyze its time complexity.

```python
def find_maximum(numbers):
    # Initialize the maximum to the first element
    maximum = numbers[0]
    
    # Iterate through the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Update maximum if a larger number is found
        if number > maximum:
            maximum = number
            
    return maximum

# Example usage
numbers = [3, 5, 1, 8, 2]
max_number = find_maximum(numbers)
print(f"The maximum number is: {max_number}")
```

### Time Complexity Analysis
- The algorithm iterates through the list once, making it O(n) in time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the list.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Implement a Sorting Algorithm
Write a function that implements the Bubble Sort algorithm. Analyze its time complexity.

### Exercise 2: Fibonacci Sequence
Write a function to compute the nth Fibonacci number using both a recursive approach and a dynamic programming approach. Compare their time complexities.

### Exercise 3: Search Algorithm
Implement a binary search algorithm. Ensure that the input list is sorted before performing the search. Analyze its time complexity.
